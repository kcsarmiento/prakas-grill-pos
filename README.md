# Prakas Grill POS (Frontend)

A **frontend prototype of a Point of Sale (POS) system** for Prakas Grill.  
Built with **Laravel Blade templates** for the UI, this version handles menu display, cart management, and checkout simulation using client-side logic.

- **Menu Display:** Browse and view menu items with prices.
- **Cart System:** Add, remove, and update items in the shopping cart.
- **Checkout Simulation:** Simulate checkout without a backend database.
- **Responsive UI:** Works across different devices and screen sizes.

This version clearly shows:  

- You’re using **Blade templates** and **public assets**.  
- It’s still frontend-only.  
- Shows how to run it in Laravel (`php artisan serve`).  

If you want, I can also **add a small “How it works” diagram section** showing the **flow: menu → cart → checkout**, which looks very professional on GitHub.  

Do you want me to add that diagram section?
